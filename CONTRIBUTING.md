## Request a new helper / feature

1. Search for an existing issue about the feature you want to suggest first.
2. Please provide your use-cases why you need the feature or problems solved.
   You can also suggest how the API could look like.
3. After your proposal we will go through a design phase where we discuss about how the feature should work.
